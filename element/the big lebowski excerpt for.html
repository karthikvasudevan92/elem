<p>THE BIG LEBOWSKI</p>

<p>We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.</p>

<p>We hear male voices
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable,
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>A way out west there was a fella,
		fella I want to tell you about, fella
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.</p>

<p>At
		least, that was the handle his lovin'
		parents gave him, but he never had
		much use for it himself.</p>

<p>This
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.</p>

<p>Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
		self-apply where I come from.</p>

<p>But
		then, there was a lot about the Dude
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense
		to me.</p>

<p>And a lot about where he
		lived, like- wise.</p>

<p>But then again,
		maybe that's why I found the place
		s'durned innarestin'.</p>

<p>We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at
twilight stretches out before us.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>They call Los Angeles the City of
		Angels.</p>

<p>I didn't find it to be that
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are
		some nice folks there.</p>

<p>'Course, I
		can't say I seen London, and I never
		been to France, and I ain't never
		seen no queen in her damn undies as
		the fella says.</p>

<p>But I'll tell you
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
		a those other places, and in English
		too, so I can die with a smile on my
		face without feelin' like the good
		Lord gypped me.</p>

<p>INTERIOR   RALPH'S</p>

<p>It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.</p>

<p>We are tracking
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the
dairy case.</p>

<p>He is the Dude.</p>

<p>His rumpled look and relaxed
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.</p>

<p>He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their
expiration dates.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>Now this story I'm about to unfold
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.</p>

<p>I
		only mention it 'cause some- times
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
		there's a man.</p>

<p>The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
milk.</p>

<p>He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
		sometimes there's a man who, wal,
		he's the man for his time'n place,
		he fits right in there--and that's
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>CHECKOUT GIRL</p>

<p>She waits, arms folded.</p>

<p>A small black-and white TV next to
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.</p>

<p>GEORGE BUSH</p>

<p>This aggression will not stand.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>This will not stand!</p>

<p>The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at
the little customer's lectern.</p>

<p>Milk beads his mustache.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>...and even if he's a lazy man, and
		the Dude was certainly that--quite
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
		County.</p>

<p>The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>...which would place him high in the
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
		sometimes there's a man.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>sometimes
		there's a man.</p>

<p>EXTERIOR  RALPH'S</p>

<p>Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.</p>

<p>There are only two or
three cars parked in the huge lot.</p>

<p>VOICE-OVER</p>

<p>Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.</p>

<p>But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
		enough.</p>

<p>The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.</p>

<p>Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.</p>

<p>The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.</p>

<p>After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>It's the LeBaron.</p>

<p>DUDE'S HOUSE</p>

<p>The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
court.</p>

<p>He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
leatherette satchel in the other.</p>

<p>He awkwardly hugs the
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.</p>

<p>INSIDE</p>

<p>The Dude enters and flicks on a light.</p>

<p>His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.</p>

<p>We track with him as he is rushed through the living room,
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.</p>

<p>Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a
hole.</p>

<p>The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of
doorframe.</p>

<p>His head is plunged into the toilet.</p>

<p>The paper
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the
floor.</p>

<p>The Dude blows bubbles.</p>

<p>VOICE</p>

<p>We want that money, Lebowski.</p>

<p>Bunny
		said you were good for it.</p>

<p>Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet.</p>

<p>The Dude blubbers and
gasps for air.</p>

<p>VOICE</p>

<p>Where's the money, Lebowski!</p>

<p>His head is plunged back into the toilet.</p>

<p>VOICE</p>

<p>Where's the money, Lebowski!</p>

<p>The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.</p>

<p>VOICE</p>

<p>WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>It's uh, it's down there somewhere.</p>

<p>Lemme take another look.</p>

<p>His head is plunged back in.</p>

<p>VOICE</p>

<p>Don't fuck with us.</p>

<p>If your wife
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
		means you owe money to Jackie
		Treehorn.</p>

<p>The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against
the toilet.</p>

<p>The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.</p>

<p>Looming over him is a strapping blond man.</p>

<p>Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
and walks over to a rug.</p>

<p>CHINESE MAN</p>

<p>Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.</p>

<p>He starts peeing on the rug.</p>

<p>The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his
sunglasses.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Oh, man.</p>

<p>Don't do--</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>You see what happens?</p>

<p>You see what
		happens, Lebowski?</p>

<p>The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.</p>

<p>You
		got the wrong guy.</p>

<p>I'm the Dude,
		man.</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>Your name is Lebowski.</p>

<p>Your wife is
		Bunny.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Bunny?</p>

<p>Look, moron.</p>

<p>He holds up his hands.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>You see a wedding ring?</p>

<p>Does this
		place look like I'm fucking married?</p>

<p>All my plants are dead!</p>

<p>The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.</p>

<p>He pulls out a
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
native.</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>The fuck is this?</p>

<p>The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights
it.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Obviously you're not a golfer.</p>

<p>The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>Woo?</p>

<p>The Chinese man is zipping his fly.</p>

<p>WOO</p>

<p>Yeah?</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
		millionaire?</p>

<p>WOO</p>

<p>Uh?</p>

<p>They both look around.</p>

<p>WOO</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>WOO</p>

<p>He looks like a fuckin' loser.</p>

<p>The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger
and peeks over them.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Hey.</p>

<p>At least I'm housebroken.</p>

<p>The two men look at each other.</p>

<p>They turn to leave.</p>

<p>WOO</p>

<p>Fuckin' waste of time.</p>

<p>The blond man turns testily at the door.</p>

<p>BLOND MAN</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, asshole.</p>

<p>ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:</p>

<p>BOWLING PINS</p>

<p>Scattered by a strike.</p>

<p>Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.</p>

<p>The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.</p>

<p>A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.</p>

<p>MAN</p>

<p>Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.</p>

<p>Mark it, Dude.</p>

<p>We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.</p>

<p>He has dark worried
eyes and a goatee.</p>

<p>Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.</p>

<p>He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves
cut off over an old bowling shirt.</p>

<p>This is Walter.</p>

<p>He
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.</p>

<p>The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears
some of its foam on his mustache.</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>This was a valued rug.</p>

<p>He elaborately clears his throat.</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>This was, uh--</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Yeah man, it really tied the room
		together--</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>This was a valued, uh.</p>

<p>Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>What tied the room together, Dude?</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>Were you listening to the story,
		Donny?</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>What--</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>Were you listening to the Dude's
		story?</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>I was bowling--</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>So you have no frame of reference,
		Donny.</p>

<p>You're like a child who
		wanders in in the middle of a movie
		and wants to know--</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>What's your point, Walter?</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>There's no fucking reason--here's my
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>Yeah Walter, what's your point?</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>What's the point of--we all know who
		was at fault, so what the fuck are
		you talking about?</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>What the fuck are you
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about
		unchecked aggression here--</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>What the fuck is he talking about?</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>My rug.</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>Forget it, Donny.</p>

<p>You're out of
		your element.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
		can't go give him a bill so what the
		fuck are you talking about?</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about?!</p>

<p>This Chinaman is not the issue!</p>

<p>I'm
		talking about drawing a line in the
		sand, Dude.</p>

<p>Across this line you do
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
		not the preferred, uh.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Asian-
		American.</p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Walter, this is not a guy who built
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
		who peed on my--</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>What the fuck are you--</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>Walter, he peed on my rug--</p>

<p>DONNY</p>

<p>He peed on the Dude's rug--</p>

<p>WALTER</p>

<p>YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!</p>

<p>This
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.</p>

<p>DUDE</p>

<p>So who--</p>
