<b>			THE BIG LEBOWSKI
</b>
We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable,
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		A way out west there was a fella,
		fella I want to tell you about, fella
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
		least, that was the handle his lovin'
		parents gave him, but he never had
		much use for it himself.  This
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
		self-apply where I come from.  But
		then, there was a lot about the Dude
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense
		to me.  And a lot about where he
		lived, like- wise.  But then again,
		maybe that's why I found the place
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at
twilight stretches out before us.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		They call Los Angeles the City of
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I
		can't say I seen London, and I never
		been to France, and I ain't never
		seen no queen in her damn undies as
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
		a those other places, and in English
		too, so I can die with a smile on my
		face without feelin' like the good
		Lord gypped me.

<b>INTERIOR   RALPH'S
</b>
It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their
expiration dates.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		Now this story I'm about to unfold
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I
		only mention it 'cause some- times
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
		sometimes there's a man who, wal,
		he's the man for his time'n place,
		he fits right in there--and that's
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

<b>CHECKOUT GIRL
</b>
She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

<b>				GEORGE BUSH
</b>		This aggression will not stand. . .
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		...and even if he's a lazy man, and
		the Dude was certainly that--quite
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		...which would place him high in the
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes
		there's a man.

<b>EXTERIOR  RALPH'S
</b>
Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or
three cars parked in the huge lot.

<b>				VOICE-OVER
</b>		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		It's the LeBaron.

<b>DUDE'S HOUSE
</b>
The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

<b>INSIDE
</b>
The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room,
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and
gasps for air.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

<b>				VOICE
</b><b>		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
</b>
<b>				DUDE
</b>		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
		means you owe money to Jackie
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
and walks over to a rug.

<b>				CHINESE MAN
</b>		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his
sunglasses.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Oh, man.  Don't do--

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		You see what happens?  You see what
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,
		man.

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is
		Bunny.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		You see a wedding ring?  Does this
		place look like I'm fucking married?
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
native.

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights
it.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

<b>				WOO
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
		millionaire?

<b>				WOO
</b>		Uh?

They both look around.

<b>				WOO
</b>		Fuck.

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		What do you think?

<b>				WOO
</b>		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger
and peeks over them.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

<b>				WOO
</b>		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

<b>				BLOND MAN
</b>		Thanks a lot, asshole.

<b>						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BOWLING PINS
</b>
Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears
some of its foam on his mustache.

<b>				WALTER
</b>		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

<b>				WALTER
</b>		This was, uh--

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Yeah man, it really tied the room
		together--

<b>				WALTER
</b>		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

<b>				DONNY
</b>		What tied the room together, Dude?

<b>				WALTER
</b>		Were you listening to the story,
		Donny?

<b>				DONNY
</b>		What--

<b>				WALTER
</b>		Were you listening to the Dude's
		story?

<b>				DONNY
</b>		I was bowling--

<b>				WALTER
</b>		So you have no frame of reference,
		Donny.  You're like a child who
		wanders in in the middle of a movie
		and wants to know--

<b>				DUDE
</b>		What's your point, Walter?

<b>				WALTER
</b>		There's no fucking reason--here's my
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

<b>				DONNY
</b>		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

<b>				WALTER
</b>		Huh?

<b>				DUDE
</b>		What's the point of--we all know who
		was at fault, so what the fuck are
		you talking about?

<b>				WALTER
</b>		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about
		unchecked aggression here--

<b>				DONNY
</b>		What the fuck is he talking about?

<b>				DUDE
</b>		My rug.

<b>				WALTER
</b>		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of
		your element.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
		can't go give him a bill so what the
		fuck are you talking about?

<b>				WALTER
</b>		What the fuck are you talking about?!
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm
		talking about drawing a line in the
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-
		American.  Please.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Walter, this is not a guy who built
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
		who peed on my--

<b>				WALTER
</b>		What the fuck are you--

<b>				DUDE
</b>		Walter, he peed on my rug--

<b>				DONNY
</b>		He peed on the Dude's rug--

<b>				WALTER
</b>		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

<b>				DUDE
</b>		So who--
